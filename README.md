# Malware-Detection-Model-Development
# Overview
This project aims to build a model for detecting malware vs. goodware using a dataset with a wide set of features. The dataset is provided by the TUNADROME project and contains 242 features in total. The goal is to set up a model to identify possible influences on malware vs. goodware and develop predictive models for classification.

# Preliminary Steps
1. Set up Jupyter Notebook in Microsoft Azure Cloud:
- Create a Jupyter Notebook environment in Microsoft Azure.
- Configure necessary compute instances.
2. Upload Dataset to Azure:
- Utilize Azure datastores to upload the dataset.
3. Data Understanding:
- Explore dataset schema, first rows, descriptive statistics, and frequency tables.
- Provide insights into the distribution of variables using charts and visualizations
3. Data Preparation:
- Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
4. Modeling
- Model 1: Logistic Regression (Baseline Model): Implement logistic regression as a baseline model for initial evaluation.
- Model 2: Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform hyperparameter tuning via grid search
5. Model Evaluation
6. Register model in Azure Cloud:
-Register the final model that best fits the data based on AUC and overfitting control.

# Management Presentation
The presentation contains core findings and the selected final model effectively. Present findings in a clear, concise manner suitable for stakeholders with limited data science knowledge.
